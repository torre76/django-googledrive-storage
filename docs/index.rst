Django Google Drive Storage
===========================

`Django Google Drive Storage <https://github.com/torre76/django-googledrive-storage/>`_
is a `Django Storage <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/files/storage/>`_
implementation that uses `Google Drive <https://drive.google.com>`_ as a backend for storing data.

Please take note that with **this implementation you could not save or load data from a user's Drive**.
You can use only a Drive **dedicated to a Google Project**. This means that:

* this storage interacts with Google Drive as a Google Project, not a Google User.
* your project can use Google Drive only through `Google Drive SDK <https://developers.google.com/drive/>`_. Because no user is associated with this Drive, **you cannot use Google Drive User Interface**.  
* this storage authenticates with Google using public private keys. See prerequisites_ for how to obtain it.
Note: It is possible to view the files if shared with a Google User account, as per `here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23382342/google-drive-access-for-service-account/>`_.

Having stated that, with this storage you gain a 15GB space hosted on Google Server where you are able to store data
using Django models.

.. _prerequisites:

Prerequisites
*************

To use this storage, you have to:

* `set up a project and application in the Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive>`_
* `obtain the json private key file (OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications) for your Google Project associated with Google Drive service <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount>`_

Installation
************

This storage is hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-googledrive-storage>`_. It can be easily installed
through *pip*:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install django-googledrive-storage

Setup
*****

Once installed, there are a few steps to configure the storage:

* add the module *gdstorage* to your installed apps in your `settings.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       ...,
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'gdstorage'
   )

* create a section in your `setting.py` that contains the configuration for this storage:

.. code-block:: python

   #
   # Google Drive Storage Settings
   #

   GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_JSON_KEY_FILE = '<path to your json private key file>'
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_MEDIA_ROOT = '<base google drive path for file uploads>' # OPTIONAL

The `GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_JSON_KEY_FILE` must be the path to *private json key file* obtained by Google. |br|
Alternatively, you can place the contents of your json private key file into an environment variable named
`GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_JSON_KEY_FILE_CONTENTS`, this requires setting `GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_JSON_KEY_FILE` to `None`.

The `GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_MEDIA_ROOT` is analogous to MEDIA_ROOT for djangoâ€™s built-in FileSystemStorage

* instantiate the storage on you `models.py` file before using into the models:

.. code-block:: python

   from gdstorage.storage import GoogleDriveStorage

   # Define Google Drive Storage
   gd_storage = GoogleDriveStorage()

Use
***

Once configured, it can be used as storage space associated with Django:

.. code-block:: python

   class Map(models.Model):
       id = models.AutoField( primary_key=True)
       map_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       map_data = models.FileField(upload_to='maps', storage=gd_storage)

.. note::

    You can get the `upload_to` parameter to ignore `GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_MEDIA_ROOT` by using an absolute path
    e.g `/maps`


File permissions
****************

Using the storage this way, all files will be saved as publicly available for read (which is the most common use case),
but sometimes you could have different reason to use Google Storage.

It is possible to specify a set of file permissions [#google_drive_permissions]_ to change how the file could be read or
written.

This code block will assign read only capabilities only to the user identified by `foo@mailinator.com`.

.. code-block:: python

   from gdstorage.storage import GoogleDriveStorage, GoogleDrivePermissionType, GoogleDrivePermissionRole, GoogleDriveFilePermission

   permission =  GoogleDriveFilePermission(
      GoogleDrivePermissionRole.READER,
      GoogleDrivePermissionType.USER,
      "foo@mailinator.com"
   )

   gd_storage = GoogleDriveStorage(permissions=(permission, ))

   class Map(models.Model):
       id = models.AutoField( primary_key=True)
       map_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       map_data = models.FileField(upload_to='maps/', storage=gd_storage)
